        <p>I did not originally start off in the Software Engineering Field. Before I began my journey into Software Engineering I attended California State University - Stanislaus studying Criminal Justice - Concentrating in Forensic Science. While I was there, during my 3rd year, I thought that I should be a Chemistry Major instead. So I did all of the paperwork to change my major and was a Chemistry Major for a Semester. Needless to say that was not a very good semester for me, so I redid all of the paperwork to switch back to my original major. After 4 1/2 years I got my Bachelor of the Arts in Criminal Justice - Concentrating in Forensic Science. It was such an interesting topic to learn and I was able to do an internship with the Stockton Polic Department's Crime Scene Investigation Unit, which was such an amazing experience! But I realized that it was not what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So here I am now a full fledged Software Engineer. Though I didn't just become one overnight. My journey here began with myself self-studying while working the Front Desk at The Marina del Rey Hotel. From there I got my AA from Santa Monica Junior College in Computer Programming. While going there I focused on disciplines such as Visual Basic, PHP, and SQL. About a year after graduating SMJC I attended CodeSmith. CodeSmith is a 3 month, day-in day-out intensive deep-dive learning program into the JavaScript and React architectures. (In layman's terms... a bootcamp). While there I got to deep dive into React Native; being a part of a 4 person team that fleshed out a full front end for a lady that was creating an application for both iOS and Android platforms. About a year and a half later and I am now a Teaching Assistant to a Bootcamp Hosted with UCLA and am getting the opportunity to teach others what I have learned thus far.</p>
